# Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Analysisüö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Cyclistic bike-share usage patterns to understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently. The goal is to help the marketing team design better strategies to convert casual riders into paying members.

## Why This Project Matters
- **Business Problem**: Cyclistic wants to increase annual memberships (they're more profitable)
- **My Role**: Junior Data Analyst identifying conversion opportunities
- **Impact**: Found potential to convert 15% of casual riders, worth ~$3.1M annually

## What I Did
1. **Data Cleaning**: Processed 6 months of bike trip data (1.2M+ records)
2. **Analysis**: Compared usage patterns between casual riders and members
3. **Visualization**: Created charts showing key differences
4. **Recommendations**: Suggested targeted marketing campaigns

## Key Findings üìä
### Usage Patterns
- **Casual riders**: Longer rides (24.6 min avg), mostly weekends
- **Annual members**: Shorter rides (12.2 min avg), consistent weekday use

### Peak Times
- **Casual riders**: Weekend evenings (5-8 PM)
- **Annual members**: Weekday rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM)

### Top Conversion Opportunities
- 20 stations show high potential for converting casual riders
- These stations have both casual and member activity during weekdays

## Tools I Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **R & RStudio**: Main analysis environment
- **tidyverse**: Data manipulation (dplyr, ggplot2)
- **R Markdown**: Created professional report
- **GitHub**: Version control and portfolio hosting
