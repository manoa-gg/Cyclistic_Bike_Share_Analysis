# ðŸš€ Business Task
# The goal of this analysis is to understand the usage patterns of Cyclistic bikes by different customer types (members vs. casual riders) to inform marketing strategies and improve customer engagement. Specifically, we aim to:
# - Identify trends in ride duration and frequency.
# - Determine the most popular times and days for bike usage.
# - Compare the behavior of members and casual riders.

# Key Findings and Strategic Recommendations
# ============================================

# Key findings:
# 1. Casual users tend to have longer rides and use the service more frequently on weekends.
# 2. While annual members have shorter rides and consistent usage throughout the week
# 3. Peak usage times and days differ significantly between the two groups of user type

# Strategic Recommendations:
# Design campaigns targeting casual users who have usage patterns similar to members
# Offer incentives such as discounts or free rides to high-potential casual users identified by clustering analysis
# Use social media and email to reach casual riders during peak weekday times
