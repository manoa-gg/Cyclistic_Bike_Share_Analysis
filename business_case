üìä Business Case: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
A Junior Data Analyst's Approach to Converting Casual Riders to Members

üéØ Executive Summary
Analysis of 4M+ bike trips reveals clear behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members, providing actionable insights for targeted conversion strategies to maximize Cyclistic's annual membership base.

üè¢ Business Context
Company Overview
Cyclistic: Chicago's premier bike-share program
Scale: 5,800+ bicycles across 692 stations
Unique Features: Inclusive options (reclining bikes, hand tricycles, cargo bikes)
Market Position: Leading mobility solution serving both leisure and commuting needs
The Business Challenge
Problem Statement: Cyclistic's finance analysts have determined that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders, but the current marketing approach targets broad consumer segments rather than focusing on high-value conversions.
Strategic Imperative: Director of Marketing Lily Moreno has identified maximizing annual memberships as critical for future growth, with casual riders representing the highest-potential conversion segment since they're already aware of and using the Cyclistic program.
My Role
As a Junior Data Analyst on the marketing analytics team, I was tasked with answering: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?" to inform data-driven conversion strategies.
